# Trip Service Kata - Test doubles

## Description:
This kata simulates a social network of trips.

We have used parametrize constructor technique to reduce the couplings inside [TripService](./src/main/java/team/codium/legacycode/tripservice/trip/TripService.java).

We want to create and use test doubles to test it.

## Goals:
- How to use test doubles
- Practice: 
  - Use a stub with Mockito
  - Create a stub manually
