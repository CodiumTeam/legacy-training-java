# Weather kata

## Description:
This kata has a simple code that request the weather prediction to Metaweather.

We want to be able to use the code with a simple interface called [Forecast](src/main/java/Forecast.java)

We also want to decouple our code from the existing dependencies.

There is a bad test suite that simplify understand how our code actually works. 

## Goals:
- How to adapt the current interface to the expected one.
- How to decouple.
- How to define an interface respecting the Dependency Inversion Principle.
